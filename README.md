Code is working.
Notes:  
had problems with newer versions of arduino.
worked on mac with version 1.0.6
May need to download some libraries:
  For Gateway may need Util.h- get it here  "https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Ethernet"
  Download as zip and add to library. see adding zip library here . "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc"
